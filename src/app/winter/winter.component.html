					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>you can know her appearance from my face and my figure. But I’m not as pretty as her .Though she is much older than me, everyone says that she looks graceful and charming. When she was at my age, she was famous for her beauty and brightness. And thanks for her slender figure, I can eat anything I like, even the chocolate as much as I want. She isn’t tall but you will never feel she’s short. She always seems independent and decisive, though she looks really mild and lovely. But she cannot bear other people say that she is prettier than me, in her opinion, only herself can say that I’m an ugly duckling.
You can know her voice from mine. Most of the people who call my family cannot tell who on earth answer the telephone, she or me. Strictly speaking, her voice sounds more like a young girl, for her voice is sweet and soft and exciting. She would be very happy if people say her voice sounds like mine, but she would be happier if my friends made a mistake to take her as me and talked to her for a long time before they found that it’s not me. She can sing many songs when she was young, even now she still likes to sing when I play my guitar. And sing with her is my favorite.
You can also know her hobbies from me. I like music, I think mostly because when she was pregnant, she taught music and sang songs and played organ everyday. She taught me harmonica when I was very young and I can play it very well. I like dance and can learn it very soon because when she was young she used to be a dancer in her school. And she still likes to dance the belly dance with me now. I can paint the traditional Chinese panting as she because she could paint many kinds of picture when she was young. Some of Her pictures were even better than mine but she herself cannot remember them. After she sent me to learn painting when I was 6, she no longer remembers that she could paint because she just kept encouraging me to keep practice no matter how bad I painted. She seemed really proud of me when my picture was showing in the school but really very confused when I asked her about her painting. Every time I was praised for my pictures, my songs, my articles and my dance, she was happier than me. She collects all my events in a notebook, to recall that little girl quite different from me now</p>
